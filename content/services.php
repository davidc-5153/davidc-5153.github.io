    We only use <strong>Keune</strong> colours to achieve the best results for our customers, 
    while maximising client comfort by reducing the chance of skin irritations. <strong>Keune</strong> tints are one of 
    the very few products on the market that do not contain PPD, a chemical responsible for many allergies and adverse skin reactions.
